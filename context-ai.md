## 🌍 Project Overview

This repository is part of a long-form illustrated novel project titled **Farming War**, a fantasy-military series with strong emphasis on:

- Monster hunting, farming, crafting, and war strategy
- Structured worldbuilding and item-based power scaling
- Multi-character progression and economic-political systems
- Party-based operations, not single overpowered protagonist

## 🧠 AI Writing Rules

- 📄 **Max output per block: ~600 words**  
- ✂️ If content is long, break into `1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`, etc.
- 🧩 Each part should be modular and mergeable by the user
- 🧱 Use Markdown for all documents, respecting filename clarity
- 🔗 Include internal links to related characters, spells, places

1. Full Name (TH + EN)

## ⛓️ AI Navigation Guidelines

1. Start at `project/` and find the latest `*-project-status.md`
2. Go to `dev/epX/epX-structure.md` and `epX-README.md`
3. Write new story content in `story/epX/epX-YY-*.md`
4. Reference relevant:
   - `characters/` → if new person appears
   - `magic/` → if new spell is used
   - `worldbuilding/` → if new place/system appears

## 🛠️ Notes for Future AI Agents

- Be consistent with formatting and tone
- Avoid symbols/emojis in actual story output
- Always respect existing structure before inserting content
- Clarify if any ambiguity or missing links are found
- Work in modular parts to prevent output cutoff
