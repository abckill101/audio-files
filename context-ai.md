##  Project Overview

This repository is part of a long-form illustrated novel project titled **Farming War**, a fantasy-military series with strong emphasis on:

- Monster hunting, farming, crafting, and war strategy
- Structured worldbuilding and item-based power scaling
- Multi-character progression and economic-political systems
- Party-based operations, not single overpowered protagonist

##  AI Writing Rules

-  **Max output per block: ~600 words**  
-  If content is long, break into `1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`, etc.
-  Each part should be modular and mergeable by the user
-  Use Markdown for all documents, respecting filename clarity
-  Include internal links to related characters, spells, places
